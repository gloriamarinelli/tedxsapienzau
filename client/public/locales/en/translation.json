The history of paradoxes is ancient, dating back to the origins of logic. However, while the first paradoxes were more like mind games, modernity has given rise to new ones within the reality that surrounds us. Justice creates inequality, opportunities that create laziness, conflicts to bring peace. Just as ancient thinkers developed paradoxes to stimulate reflection, we too must face, not avoid, the paradoxes that permeate the nature of the human world in order to sprout ideas that can improve it. PARA DOXA will be the fertile ground to cultivate them."
